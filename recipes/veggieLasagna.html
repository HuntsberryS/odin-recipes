    <p>This Vegetarian Lasagna is hearty, colorful, and full of flavor, proving you don’t need meat to enjoy a rich and satisfying lasagna. Layers of pasta are stacked with a medley of sautéed vegetables—like zucchini, bell peppers, mushrooms, and spinach—paired with a creamy ricotta-Parmesan filling. Everything is brought together with tangy marinara sauce and melty mozzarella cheese. It’s a vibrant, nutrient-packed meal that’s both comforting and wholesome. Ideal for weeknight dinners, meatless Mondays, or serving guests with varied dietary preferences, it’s a delicious celebration of garden-fresh flavors.</p>
