    <p>Chicken Alfredo Lasagna is a creamy, indulgent twist on the traditional lasagna. Layers of tender shredded chicken, velvety ricotta, and fresh spinach are nestled between sheets of pasta and smothered in a rich homemade Alfredo sauce made with butter, cream, and Parmesan cheese. Melted mozzarella blankets the top, turning golden and bubbly in the oven. The result is a comforting, savory dish that’s elegant enough for guests but cozy enough for a family dinner. It’s perfect for those who love creamy pasta dishes and want something a little different than the classic tomato-based lasagna.</p>
